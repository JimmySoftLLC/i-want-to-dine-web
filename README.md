# iWantToDine-WebSite

This is the landing page for iWantToDine.com until a prototype is online.  The front end of the react application is being developed in the repository [i-want-to-dine-front-end](https://github.com/JimmySoftLLC/i-want-to-dine-front-end).

The main vision for the product is as follows

> When you are on vacation you want to get something to eat, but don't know what. So you walk around and look at menus that are posted outside resturants. You go online and look but all you find is a mishmash of bias reviews.
> 
> What if there was an app that did the walking and searching for you. Let's say you want a steak. You press the steak button and all the steak entrees in town are listed. You press fish and all the fish options show up. You press specials and all the specials show up.
> 
> This is the inspiration for iWantToDine.com. A website that only contains curated information submitted by the resturant owners. This is personal, just like the server was handing you the menu and telling you todays specials.
> 
> There is no app today that gives you that experience. This will be exciting!
